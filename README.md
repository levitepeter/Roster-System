ROSTER SYSTEM IN DJANGO 

*The app keeps track of the eligibility and role of volunteers and schedules them accordingly as Sound-Head, Setup-Head, Admin, Team and Packup-Team. 

*Rostering is automated ensuring equal distribution of work. Based on the frequency of availability provided by the volunteers and continuity of work, the application manages to roster efficiently.

*Reduces the load on Admin and thus saves time.
